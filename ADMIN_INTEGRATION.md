## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Admin button not showing**: Make sure the user has `is_admin=True` in the database

If you encounter database errors:
```bash
python migrate_db.py
```

If you need to reset the admin password:
```python
from app import app, db
from models import User

with app.app_context():
    admin = User.query.filter_by(username='admin').first()
    admin.set_password('new_password')
    db.session.commit()
```
